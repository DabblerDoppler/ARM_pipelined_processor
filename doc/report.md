## Overview
A five-stage pipelined processor implementing an 11-instruction subset of the ARMv8-A architecture. This project largely was completed without using built-in arithmetic or memory constructsâ€”every component, including adders and multiplexers, was constructed at the gate level. The exceptions to this are instruction decoding in CPU.sv, and datamem and instructmem, which use always_comb blocks. 

## Specifications
- **ISA**: Subset of ARMv8-A
- **Pipeline stages**: IF, ID/RF, EX, MEM, WB
- **Instruction count**: 11
- **Technology**: SystemVerilog, gate-level modules
- **Testing**: Self-contained simulation framework with test programs, modelsim

## Architecture

### Datapath and Control Flow

The CPU follows a classic five-stage pipelined datapath. The stages are:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**  
   The Program Counter (PC) selects the current instruction address, which is used to fetch an instruction from instruction memory. PC is incremented every cycle unless a branch condition overrides it.

2. **Register Fetch (RF)**  
   The fetched instruction is decoded. Source register addresses are used to read from the register file. Immediate values are sign-extended if needed. Control signals are generated for the rest of the pipeline based on the instruction opcode and function bits. Branch logic for B.LT and B is determined.

3. **Execute (EX)**  
   The ALU performs the arithmetic or logical operation using operands from the RF stage. This stage handles CBZ target calculation as well.

4. **Memory Access (MEM)**  
   For load and store instructions, this stage accesses data memory. It also includes data forwarding and control hazard resolution. All store operations and conditional branches are resolved here. Load instructions forward the data to WB.

5. **Write Back (WB)**  
   The result from the ALU or memory is written back to the register file. A mux controlled by the `read_mem` signal determines the source of the writeback data.

### Control Flow

Control signals are generated in the RF stage and propagate down the pipeline. Forwarding logic prevents data hazards by dynamically selecting between register file data, MEM results, or WB results using multiplexers. Branch control flow is managed in the EX and MEM stages, allowing for early PC redirection when needed.

The entire pipeline is synchronized on a positive-edge clock. Reset initializes all pipeline registers and control paths. Bubble insertion (NOP injection) is used when hazards require it, and a global stall signal halts instruction fetch to maintain pipeline correctness.

### `datamem.sv`
RAM module for data storage. This module was provided as part of my EE469 class, and is not implemented from the gate level.
Has parameterized size and uses little-endian encoding.
- Inputs: `address`, `write_enable`, `read_enable`, `write_data`, `clk`, `xfer_size`

### `equality_checker.sv`
A module which checks if two five-bit inputs are equal, and outputs 1 only if they are.
Cleaner implementations are possible than this one, but my original project requirements were no gates with more than 4 inputs.
I may rewrite this module to be width scalable and utilize an appropriate number of AND gates later.

### `instructmem.sv`
This is the instruction memory - it reads and stores a .arm file in a way the CPU can read. This was provided as part of my EE469 class, so it isn't written from the gate level.
- Inputs: `address`, `clk`
	*Note: the clock is only used for error checking through assert statements.
- Outputs: `instruction`
- implements: none

### `inverter.sv`
This is a parameterized-width inverter module which inverts the bits by notting them and then adding one, making them the negative version of the same number for signed operations.
